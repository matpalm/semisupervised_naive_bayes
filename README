an experiment in semi supervised naive bayes text classification

a walk through of the project is available at http://matpalm.com/semi_supervised_naive_bayes

in general run things up with
bash> bzcat perez.bz2 thereg.bz2 | shuf | head -300 | ./shorten_urls.rb | ./main.rb

v2 scalable version

some troubles
- in general the ssnb never seems to beat the nb
- never needs to run more than once, convergence is 1 iteration ??

need to rethink the convergence / distribution stuff...
