an experiment in semi supervised naive bayes text classification

a walk through of the project is available at http://matpalm.com/semi_supervised_naive_bayes

in general run things up with
bash> bzcat perez.bz2 thereg.bz2 | shuf | head -300 | ./main.rb

there's a problem with a large unlabelled set causing float overflow. to retain umerical accuracy
this code keeps fractions in rational form (ie 0.5 is represented as [1,2]) and in some
calculations, particularly lowest common denominator for additive smoothing, the denominators
go through the roof and fail when being to_f'd. one day i might come back and fix it but things
were ok for experimental proof of concept data sets sizes; ie 300 articles.
