an experiment in semi supervised naive bayes text classification

a walk through of the project is available at http://matpalm.com/semi_supervised_naive_bayes

in general run things up with
bash> bzcat perez.bz2 thereg.bz2 | shuf | head -300 | ./shorten_urls.rb | ./main.rb

git tag v1_diy_fractions
nominal naive bayes implementation with diy rational arithmetic
fails due to numerical overflow

git tag v2_fractions_using_rational
rewrite using ruby's native Rational object
fails for same reason as v1

git tag v3_multinominal_rewrite
rewrite using multinominal naive bayes and explicit bucketing of articles into a class rather than
retained distributions (quick test showed that the unlabelled articles almost ALWAYS followed a distribution
along the lines of 0.99/0.01 anyways (??)) 

TODO
convergence of unlabelled set is always in a single iteration; this rings some warning bells for me.
even though it works something isn't right; perhaps should introduce unlabelled values incrementally?
