<h1>but does it do any better? (v2)</h1>

<h2>rerunning the same tests</h2>

<p>
let's rerun <a href="does_it_do_any_better.html">the same tests</a>, using the same method, we did before.
</p>

<p>
again as a test i took a random sample of 300 rss articles from a total of 8000.
</p>

<p>
30 articles were used for the training set, 30 for the test set with a varying number were used for the unlablled extras.
</p>

<p>
the experiment was repeated 7 times for a different random 300 articles with the results plotted below showing the addition gain over naive bayes (nb) using a semi supervised version (ssnb) with 20, 50, 100 or 200 unlabelled examples.
</p>

</p>

<p>
in every case we can see having the adding additional unlablled data makes an improvement. yay!</br>
it's interesting that, for run 1 and 3, 200 unlabelled examples did no better than 100 unlabelled examples.</br>
in general, seems semi supervised works pretty well!
</p>

<p>
trouble is my clumsy implementation doesn't scale so we <a href="rewriting_for_scale.html">need to change it</a>
