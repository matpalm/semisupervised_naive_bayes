<h1>but does it do any better? (v2)</h1>

<h2>rerunning the same tests</h2>

<p>
let's rerun <a href="does_it_do_any_better.html">the same tests</a>, using the same method, we did before.
</p>

<p>
again as a test i took a random sample of 300 rss articles from a total of 8000.
</p>

<p>
30 articles were used for the training set, 30 for the test set with a varying number were used for the unlablled extras.
</p>

<p>
the experiment was repeated 7 times for a different random 300 articles with the results plotted below showing the addition gain over naive bayes (nb) using a semi supervised version (ssnb) with 20, 50, 100 or 200 unlabelled examples.
</p>

</p>

<p>
an interesting thing to note is that the default multinominal supervised classifier does a hell of a lot better than the default nominal supervised classifier before we even consider the semi supervised part...
<p>

<p>
it also scales well past 200 articles but, doesn't really need it for this simple two class problem it seems
</p>

<p>
TODO!
a 5-6 class problem and some graphs showing some real scaling, in the mean time i've got <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/tag/e10">distracted by something else!</a>
