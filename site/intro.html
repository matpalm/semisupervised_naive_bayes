<h1>semi supervised algorithms</h1>

<p>
firstly what is a semi supervised algorithm?
</p>

<h2>supervised learning</h2>
<p>
a <em>supervised</em> learning algorithm is one where <em>all</em> of the training examples are labelled.</br>
in this case we are trying to predict a feature of a new example.
</p>

<p>
eg. given catergorised training data
<table>
<thead><tr><td>height</td><td>colour</td><td>class</td></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>10cm</td><td>red</td><td>widget</td>
<tr><td>15cm</td><td>blue</td><td>widget</td>
<tr><td>10cm</td><td>blue</td><td>foobar</td>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>
what might we predict the class of a new item to be?
<table>
<thead><tr><td>height</td><td>colour</td><td>class</td></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>15cm</td><td>green</td><td>???</td>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>

<h2>unsupervised learning</h2>
<p>
an <em>unsupervised</em> learning algorithm is one where <em>none</em> of our training examples are labelled.</br>
in this case we are just looking to find patterns in the data.
</p>
<p>
clustering is a classic example of an unsupervised algorithm.
</p>

<h2>semi supervised learning</h2>
<p>
a <em>semi supervised</em> learning algorithm is one where, wait for it, <em>some</em> of the training examples are labelled.</br>
</p>

<p>
a good example of this is categorising text documents.</br>
we might have a large existing corpus of documents but can only afford to label some of the data.</br>
it is worth trying to use the entire corpus though since it might contain some inherent structure.
</p>

<p>
now let's have a look at <a href="semi_supervised_bayes.html">a semi supervised version of naive bayes</a>
