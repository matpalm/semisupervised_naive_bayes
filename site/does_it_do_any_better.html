<h2>comparing plain supervised naive bayes vs semi supervised naive bayes</h2>

<p>
as a test i took a random sample of 300 rss articles from a total of 8000. there was roughly a 50/50 split of articles between perez hilton and the register.
</p>

<p> 
they were partitioned into 3 sets...
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>article set</td><td>number articles</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>labelled training</td> <td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>labelled test</td> <td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>unlabelled training</td> <td>240</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>
a standard naive bayes classifier was training using the <em>labelled training</em> set and evaluated for correctness using the <em>labelled test</em> set.
</p>

<p>
a semi supervised naive bayes classifier was trained with both the <em>labelled training</em> and <em>unlabelled training</em> sets using the scheme 
we've been discussing.correctness was again evaluated using the <em>labelled test</em> set.
</p>

<p>
the experiment was repeated 7 times for a different random 300 articles with the results plotted below showing the addition gain over naive bayes (nb) using a semi supervised version (ssnb) with 20, 50, 100 or 200 unlabelled examples.
</p>

<p>
in every case we can see having the adding additional unlablled data makes an improvement. yay!</br>
it's interesting that, for run 1 and 3, 200 unlabelled examples did no better than 100 unlabelled examples.</br>
in general, seems semi supervised works pretty well!
</p>

<p>
trouble is my clumsy implementation doesn't scale so we <a href="rewriting_for_scale.html">need to change it</a>
